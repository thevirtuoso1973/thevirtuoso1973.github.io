## Things I should probably do
- Try coding some machine-learning algorithms (might be good practice of Python skills)
- Investigate the Monero project open-source code, seems interesting.
- Complete (or attempt another) edX course (slightly time-consuming).
- Use my Linux machine more, should probably become more adjusted to terminal.

# Learning Goals - Topics to become proficient at:
- **Cybersecurity** - begin with networking protocols/web servers, try edX course?
- **Encryption/Cryptography** - explore hashing types and cryptography
- **Data Science** - data science _seems_ to be considered the best job in CompSci, however possibly more difficult to demonstrate ability compared to SWE (where you can just link projects you've done).
- **Financial Cybersystems** - another good field of CompSci; FinTech: blockchain, data mining, lots of good technology involved.

# Things I have Done
- Learned a decent amount of JavaScript
- Explored some basic machine-learning algorithms.
- Built a small maze game/generator program that runs on JavaScript (see below).

_Note to self: don't try learning everything at once._
