## Things I should probably do
- Learn more CSS
- Learn more JavaScript
- Try coding some machine-learning algorithms (might be good practice of Python skills)
- Investigate the Monero project open-source code, seems interesting.
- Complete (or attempt another) edX course - slightly time-consuming unfortunately.
- Use my Linux machine more, should probably become more adjusted to terminal.

# Learning Goals - Topics to become proficient at:
- **Cybersecurity** - begin with networking protocols/web servers, try edX course
- **Encryption/Cryptography** - explore hashing types and cryptography
- **Data Science** - data scientists _seem_ to be considered the best job in CompSci, doesn't seem quite as interesting as the other jobs though unfortunately.
- **Financial Cybersystems** - another good field of CompSci; FinTech: blockchain, data mining, lots of good technology involved.

_Note to self: don't try learning everything at once._

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/thevirtuoso1973/thevirtuoso1973.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
