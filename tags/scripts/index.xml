          Introduction  This will be a short example-based guide to (a) awk (b) gnuplot and (c) using them in a script.
 I needed to graph some data based on the output of a command run a couple times. So what better way to solve that five minute task than to spend an hour learning awk &amp;amp; gnuplot to automate it?
  The Problem  I needed to compare how long a program says it takes with how long it actually takes to execute.
