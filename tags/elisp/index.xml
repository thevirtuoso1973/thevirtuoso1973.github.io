          Introduction  This will be a short post on how I use custom sources for the Doom Emacs calendar module; in particular, a iCalendar/ics source.
 Whenever I mention &amp;#39;Doom&amp;#39;, I&amp;#39;m referring to Doom Emacs.
  Prerequisites  A basic understanding of how to use Doom Emacs, and some familiarity with Lisp-like languages.
  Getting the Calendar  Firstly, you&amp;#39;ll want to activate the calendar module in your init.

          Intro So, inevitably, as one delves deeper into their editor of choice, one finds themselves wishing to customise it to some extent.
Vim can handle this sufficiently, but I found myself reaching the point where my vim config started to get a little bit cluttered. So, after having a look at Emacs, I decided to make the switch, courtesy of Doom Emacs.
The init.el file in the private config already handles most of the configuration you&amp;rsquo;d want to get started with, but there were two things I added to my config.
