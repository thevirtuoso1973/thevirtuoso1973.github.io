<h2>Things I should probably do</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Try coding some machine-learning algorithms (might be good practice of Python skills)</li>
  <li>Investigate the Monero project open-source code, seems interesting.</li>
  <li>Complete (or attempt another) edX course (slightly time-consuming).</li>
  <li>Use my Linux machine more, should probably become more adjusted to terminal.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning Goals - Topics to become proficient at:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Cybersecurity - begin with networking protocols/web servers, try edX course?</li>
  <li>Encryption/Cryptography - explore hashing types and cryptography</li>
  <li>Data Science - data science seems to be considered the best job in CompSci, however possibly more difficult to demonstrate ability compared to SWE (where you can just link projects you've done).</li>
  <li>Financial Cybersystems - another good field of CompSci; FinTech: blockchain, data mining, lots of good technology involved.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Things I have Done</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Learned a decent amount of JavaScript</li>
  <li>Explored some basic machine-learning algorithms.</li>
  <li>Built a small maze game/generator program that runs on JavaScript (see projects).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note to self: don't try learning everything at once.</p>
