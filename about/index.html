title: About Me
---
<p>Hello! Welcome to my personal site. (I mostly added this 'about' page for completeness. The other sections have the interesting stuff, I recommend visiting the project section and playing with the maze to start with.)</p> 
<p><i>20/09/2019</i></p>
<h2>Things I should probably do</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Try coding some machine-learning algorithms (might be good practice of Python skills)</li>
  <li>Investigate the Monero project open-source code, seems interesting.</li>
  <li>Complete (or attempt another) edX course (slightly time-consuming).</li>
  <li>Try out and learn a variety of languages for a variety of fields - e.g. Haskell for functional programming, R for data science stuff, C++ for low level programs (relative to Python or R).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning Goals - topics to become proficient at:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Cybersecurity - begin with networking protocols/web servers, try edX course?</li>
  <li>Encryption/Cryptography - explore hashing types and cryptography</li>
  <li>Data Science - data science seems to be considered the best job in CompSci, however possibly more difficult to demonstrate ability compared to SWE (where you can just link projects you've done).</li>
  <li>Financial Cybersystems - another good field of CompSci; FinTech: blockchain, data mining, lots of good technology involved.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Things I have done</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Learned a decent amount of JavaScript</li>
  <li>Explored some basic machine-learning algorithms.</li>
  <li>Built a small maze game/generator program that runs on JavaScript. (See projects)</li>
  <li>Grown a lot more familiar to Linux over the past year.</li>
  <li>Wrote a python script built for use in a terminal with youtube-dl. 
    Makes downloading vids super convenient when working in the terminal. (See projects)</li>
  <li>Extended the Mycroft-AI software to allow Mycroft to play downloaded/local music files. Not published officialy for Mycroft since it's a fairly specific use case, but available on GitHub for anyone to use.</li>
</ul>
