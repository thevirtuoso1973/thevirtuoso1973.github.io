  <h2>Personal Interests:</h2>
<p>I enjoy ‘hobby-coding’ where I complete challenges on coding/programming websites to get high scores and try to develop more efficient algorithms than the other users on the site. In addition, I like undertaking small coding projects and browsing/inspecting other people’s open-source projects on Github.<br>
I have a deep musical interest and spend time every week practicing the guitar, as well as occasionally engaging in song writing. I previously studied and received a ‘Merit’ in Grade 2 Guitar, however in recent years I have purely self-taught myself.<br>
This is a significant trait of mine (in many aspects of my life), as I scarcely wait to be taught how to do something, instead devoting my spare time to learning it myself if I can. This I believe is a valuable asset and has allowed me to gather a breadth of general knowledge, applicable and useful to any job.<br>
For example, I had wished to learn about business and economics but I had already used up my choices for GCSE, therefore I began to intermittently teach myself the basics, that were never taught in school – but I believed to be invaluable in the real world. These basics included finance, investment and politics.</p>
