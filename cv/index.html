  <h2>Personal Interests:</h2>
  <p>
    I enjoy ‘hobby-coding’ where I complete challenges on coding/programming
    websites to get high scores and try to develop more efficient algorithms
    than the other users on the site. In addition, I like undertaking small coding projects and browsing/inspecting other people’s open-source projects on Github.<br>
    I have a deep musical interest and spend time every week practicing the
    guitar, as well as occasionally engaging in song writing. I previously
    studied and received a ‘Merit’ in Grade 2 Guitar, however in recent years I have purely self-taught myself.<br>
